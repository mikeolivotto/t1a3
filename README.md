## About the app

### Description

\- **describe** at a high level what the application will do
\- **identify** the problem it will solve and **explain** why you are developing it
\- **identify** the target audience
\- **explain** how a member of the target audience will use it



### Features

**Develop** a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
\- at least THREE **features**
\- **describe** each feature

**Note:** **Ensure** that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
\- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

\- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
\- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.



## App creation



**Develop** an implementation plan which:
\- **outlines** how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
\- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
\- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

\> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
